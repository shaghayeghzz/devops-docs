Ansible Vault is a feature within Ansible, an open-source IT automation tool, that allows you to securely store and manage sensitive data, such as passwords, API keys, or any other private information. It helps keep your automation process safe by encrypting files and variables that might contain sensitive information.
Key Features of Ansible Vault:

    Encryption of sensitive data: You can encrypt files, such as YAML files that store variables or configurations, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed in plaintext.

    Secure handling: Vault can encrypt and decrypt the data using a password or a secret key. This ensures that only authorized users can access the information.

    Integration with playbooks: Ansible Vault is seamlessly integrated with Ansible playbooks, allowing you to run automation tasks while using encrypted data in a secure manner.

    Granular control: You can encrypt entire files or just specific variables within a file, giving you flexibility in how sensitive data is handled.

    Easy management: You can edit encrypted files, view encrypted content, or even encrypt/decrypt them using simple commands.
